TASK 3 ASSIGNMENT 2

a) Formally describe the regular grammar of the lexemes in Task 1

We have 3 different lexemes in task 1, they are numbers, operators and commands

<number> ::= 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5

<operator> ::= + | - | * | / 

<command> ::= p | d | i | c

b)  Describe the grammar of the records returned by the ExpressionTree function in Task 3, using (E)BNF.

If (E)BNF is the way used in a) the solution should be stated as,

<record> ::=
        | plus(<statement>)
        | minus(<statement>)
        | multiply(<statement>)
        | divide(<statement>)

c) Which kind of grammar is the grammar you defined in step a)? Is it regular, context-free, context-sensitive,
or unconstrained? What about the one from step b)?
    step a) regular
    steb b) context-sensitive
